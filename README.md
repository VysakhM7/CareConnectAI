My capstone project aims to build an AI-powered platform for holistic elderly care, focusing on both physical safety and mental wellness. By analyzing health metrics, activity levels, and adherence to reminders, the system will identify early indicators of issues like depression, loneliness, or cognitive decline. The platform will serve as a real-time support system for caregivers, helping ensure timely interventions and promoting a better quality of life for elderly individuals.

To amplify its impact, I plan to collaborate with hospitals, elderly care tech startups, healthcare providers, and academic institutions. I also aim to contribute to scholarly publications such as JMIR and share insights at conferences like AI for Good and HealthTech Summit. With platforms like TEDx and Google for Startups, I will showcase the project's societal relevance and scalability. Ultimately, the project aspires to influence global elderly care practices through strategic partnerships with governments and NGOs.
